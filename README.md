# Repliation material for: "A Nodewise Regression Approach to Estimating Large Portfolios"


## Simulation results 

To replicate the simulation results in the paper two steps are necessary.

 1. Running the simulations and saving summary statistics. Simulations are launched using the `sim_scripts/sim_setup_script.R` file. Upon completion of the simulation, a `rds` object containing a set of statistics is saved.
 2. Producing the figures in the paper. The figures in the paper are generated using the `sim_scripts/sim_figs.Rnw` Rmarkdown file.
